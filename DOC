For each standby list request, we branch a new thread into the standby list (via semwait). [hence 4 traces "fail", but they should work]
Upon entering the sempaphore.c, the thread will wait on a condition variable until one fo the pending seats is freed.
How to test standby list:
./http_server 3
open up 5 tabs. 
reserve 1 seat with one user ID
Pend the other two with usr ID 2+3
With tabs 4 and 5 click on any of the seats that were put into standby, (browser must not be refreshed)
Then go back to tabs 3 and 2 and hit "cancel"
Pay attention to the output printing on console screen to verify that right user ID's are getting added to open seats(or through other means)

Seats.c and semaphore.c functions sommunicate with each other everytime all the seats are empty and we need to add a 
request to the standby list OR a seat gets taken out of pending state, (in this even there will be a broadcast to wake standby up)

We implimented a queue in the semaphore to keep track of which threads were there first. Contact me if you want help walking through this

We use 10 threads to


After playing around on our machines with thread count, we found that the best results, (average responsetime )was when we set the
amount of threads was between 10-20
